Announcing Write the Docs conferences for 2023
==============================================

We're excited to announce two Write the Docs conferences for 2023:

* Write the Docs Portland on May 7-10, 2023, an in person conference in Portland, Oregon.
* Write the Docs Atlantic, on September 10-12, 2023, a new virtual conference
  in between European and US East coast timezones.

Write the Docs Prague is taking a break this year. Announcements about
Write the Docs Australia will follow later in 2023.

Write the Docs Portland
-----------------------
Write the Docs Portland will be an in person conference, similar to our
pre-COVID conferences. Speakers will be present in person and speaking
from the conference stage. We will also offer a free live stream, and remote
participants are encouraged to participate in our Slack, as for any of
our previous in person conferences. The conference will follow all local
COVID regulations that apply at the time. The unconference will not
be streamed.

Write the Docs Atlantic
-----------------------
Write the Docs Atlantic is a new conference, similar to our virtual
conferences from the last few years. The schedule will run from the
early afternoon to early evening in most European/African timezones,
and from early morning to late afternoon in US East coast timezones.
Of course, this being a virtual conference, attendees and speakers
are welcomed from anywhere in the world.

Virtual and in person
---------------------
Although we initially did virtual conferences due to COVID, we found
that despite some downsides, they also create many new opportunities.
There are many people that have difficulty travelling
to our in person conferences, due to financial, health, or immigration
reasons. With a virtual conference, these people have equal access to
our events, as speakers or attendees. We've also seen that our
community has been great at bringing the same atmosphere that works
so well at our in person conferences, to our virtual ones.

Therefore, we think that the Portland and Atlantic conferences together
are a great way to bring back the familiar that many of you miss,
while also keeping the many benefits of virtual conferences in 2023.

Call for Proposals
------------------
For both conferences, we invite people from all across our community to
come up on the virtual or in person stage to share their insights and experience.
We're looking for ideas and use-cases from all disciplines and roles,
so whether you're a technical writer, developer, UX designer, community manager,
or support professional who cares about content and communication, we want to hear from you!

**We plan to launch our Portland CFP in early January 2023** for those who are excited to speak.
The talks in Portland will be in person.

Further details of the Atlantic CFP will be announced later in 2023.
For Atlantic, all talks will be pre-recorded again, so you'll be able to present from anywhere.

Start thinking about your talk proposal now, and we'll let you know as soon as the CFPs open.


Tickets
-------
**Tickets will go on sale in TODO**.
We will announce ticket prices soon, so that you can start planning your budget.

As always, we keep ticket prices low so that it is accessible to the widest range
of people possible. However, if you can't afford these prices and still wish to attend,
we will be running our Opportunity Grants program again this year.

Sponsorship
-----------

We are always grateful for the organizations and projects that support our
community and help make our events extra awesome for the attendees.
